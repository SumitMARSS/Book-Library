    c. express: This is a web framework for Node.js used to build the RESTful API.
      npm install express
      
    d. mongoose: This module is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
      npm install mongoose
    e. nodemon: This module automatically restarts the server whenever changes are detected in the source code, which is useful during development.
      npm install nodemon --save-dev
      
### Make sure to install any other modules specified in the project's package.json file.

Environment Variables:This project might require some environment variables for configurations such as database connection strings, JWT secret, etc. 
Make sure to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add necessary variables. An example .env file might look like this:
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/booklibrary
    JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
    
## Run the Project:
  npm run dev
This will start the backend server. You can now make requests to the API.

## Additional Notes:
    Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine or update the MONGODB_URI in the .env file to connect to your MongoDB instance.
    Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine before running any npm commands.
    For detailed instructions on setting up the frontend or any additional configurations, refer to the project's documentation or README.md file.
    That's it! You've successfully set up the Book Library Backend project on your local machine. Happy coding!
